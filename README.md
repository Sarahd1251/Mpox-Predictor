# Mpox-Predictor

***

## Project Description
The link from our interactive website has brought you to our teamâ€™s shared Github Page. This page has folders that contain our code as well as some of the major graphics and functions that are used throughout our website. This page is intended to give the user more insight into what it is we hope that our website is able to achieve. The Mpox outbreak first started affecting the United States when the first case was reported in May of 2022. Mpox symptoms usually begin three weeks after exposure and symptoms generally last 2-4 weeks.

Symptoms Include:
-Rash near genitals, hands, face, feet, or mouth
  -Rash looks like small blisters or pimples that eventually turn into scabs 
  -Rash is painful and itchy
-Fever
-Chills
-Swollen lymph nodes
-Exhaustion
-Head and muscle aches
-Respiratory symptoms

Transmission:
-Can be transmitted from time the symptoms start until the rash has fully healed
-Direct contact of rash
-Intimate contact
-Saliva
-Other bodily fluids

The purpose of the website is to create an international prediction model for Mpox cases. The hope is that the user will gain valuable knowledge that is up to date on Mpox cases that will allow them to better understand how the disease affects a specific part of the world. Ultimately, the website and the offered knowledge may help users to choose whether it is safe to travel to a specific country based on contamination levels and hopefully contain the spread of Mpox cases.
